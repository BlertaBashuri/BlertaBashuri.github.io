        <p>Blerta Bashuri, a 30-year-old artist, is a contemporary realist painter who lives and studies in Ottawa, Canada.
            She was born and raised in the country of eagles, Albania. Her colourful paintings are related to her adventurous spirit and vibrant life. Her distinctive personal style emanates joy and peace and expresses the vibrant spirit and atmosphere of the positive culture. Blerta’s favourite quote is:
             “I am a storyteller, and I welcome you to join me on this visual journey.” As a child, Blerta’s family couldn’t afford the painting classes, so the only thing she was doing was painting in the boxes of the fruits and vegetables that her family was buying. Her middle school teacher was gifting every month a box of paintings to her.
             On her 18th birthday, she got her first Canva where she could have paint, and her sister gifted her computer to her. From that moment, she started to work and save money for her University.</p></div>
            <div class="paragraph_2">
           
             <p>
            She got accepted into one of the most expensive universities in her country, but she was an excellent student and got a bursary and paid only a tiny amount of money. Blerta was part of the Dean’s Honours list and was lucky to get a job in Graphic Design when she was in her last year of the University. That was helpful for her to be able to show the world how talented she was.
            After seven years away from her family, she moved to Ottawa, Canada, where her parents lived. Blerta decided to invest all her savings in starting another school in Ottawa related to her previous University back home. She started Interactive Media Design. So far, she is doing great, and she is talented. 
            If you want to buy her paintings or look at her work, please enjoy your journey on this portfolio website. Hope you enjoy and get insipered from her work. Enjoy the colours of Blerta's Art and life.
