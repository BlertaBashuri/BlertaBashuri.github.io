           <h3>A Little bit about Blerta&period;&period;&period;</h3>
           <p>
            Thirty years old from Tirana, Albania&period; I studied Art Design and worked a year and a half in the industry&period; 
            I have always been very passionate about art design&comma; travelling and bicycling&period;  
            As a cruise ship member&comma; of <i>Crystal Cruises <abbr title="Limited">LTD</abbr></i>&comma; I have been around the world for almost four years&period; 
            I visited <strong><em>50 countries</em></strong>&comma; to be exact&period; I am living in Ottawa <mark>since December 2019</mark>&comma; and Canada is love at first sight&period; 
            </p>
        
        
           <p> I love a lot about the Canadian capital city&period; It&apos;s bike trails and countless parks are my favourites&comma; especially when I have a camera with me&comma; to take pictures of squirrels and groundhogs running around Dowâ€™s Lake&period; 
Having a pet has always been something that I have wished for my birthdays since I was a little girl but unfortunately one of my family members is allergic&comma; so I have always had to stop by a pet shop back home to spend some time petting the cats and dogs in that store&period; Well&comma; this pandemic hasn&apos;t allowed me yet to visit a pet shop here in Ottawa&period;
Hopefully on my 31<sup>st</sup> birthday I will be able to get one&period;
