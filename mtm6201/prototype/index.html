                            Delicious, handcrafted ice cream starts with natural and organic locally-sourced
                            ingredients. It’s a little concept I like to call farm-to-frozen. I personally make all the
                            ice cream which is made in the kitchen just behind the counter, its a small but mighty
                            space! The creative ice creams, including dairy and dairy-free have received accolades both
                            in Ottawa and nationally.
                            Yum Cream is open 7 days a week, even in the winter time. </p>
                            <p>The shop opened in 2000 and the ice cream that is made here is the best ice cream we know
                                how to make. Quality ingredients is the backbone here and even though prices may be
                                lower then other ice cream shops, its the standard of excellence that we like to be
                                measured by. </p>

            <p>Madagascar Vanilla
                If you want to know how fresh our ice cream is, give Madagascar Vanilla a try. We use both vanilla beans
                and extract grown in the Madagascar region. We don't mess around with this robust and full-bodied flavor
                with notes of bourbon and caramel.
                Ingredients: Autumnwood Farm cream and milk, cane sugar, organic egg yolks, Madagascar vanilla extract

                TC Chocolate in Fergus Falls, Minn is highlighted in this flavor. They are a bean-to-bar chocolatier
                meaning they purchase raw cocoa beans and do the laborious work of turning these beans into chocolate
                bars. The canvas of this flavor is a milky chocolate using their 70% cocoa bars. We melt this into
                Autumnwood Dairy’s milk and cream and then speckle this base, as the ice cream is churning, with their
                60% chocolate and you get bits of truffle-like goodness. Seriously local, seriously a must try.
                Ingredients: Autumnwood Farm cream and milk, cane sugar, Terroir Chocolate 60% (organic cocoa beans,
