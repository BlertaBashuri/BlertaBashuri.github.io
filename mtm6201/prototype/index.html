                        Delicious, handcrafted ice cream starts with natural and organic locally-sourced
                        ingredients. It’s a little concept I like to call farm-to-frozen. I personally make all the
                        ice cream which is made in the kitchen just behind the counter, its a small but mighty
                        space! The creative ice creams, including dairy and dairy-free have received accolades both
                        in Ottawa and nationally.
                        Yum Cream is open 7 days a week, even in the winter time. </p>
                    <p>The shop opened in 2000 and the ice cream that is made here is the best ice cream we know
                        how to make. Quality ingredients is the backbone here and even though prices may be
                        lower then other ice cream shops, its the standard of excellence that we like to be
                        measured by. </p>

            <p>Madagascar Vanilla
                If you want to know how fresh our ice cream is, give Madagascar Vanilla a try. We use both vanilla beans
                and extract grown in the Madagascar region. We don't mess around with this robust and full-bodied flavor
                with notes of bourbon and caramel.
                Ingredients: Autumnwood Farm cream and milk, cane sugar, organic egg yolks, Madagascar vanilla extract
                and beans.</p>
            <h3>Chocolate</h3>
            <p>We use the robust Guittard Rogue chocolate to make this flavor rich and fudgy. It's chocolate ice cream
                the best way we know how to make it. If you are a chocolate fanatic, we made this one for you.
                Ingredients: Autumnwood Farm cream and milk, cane sugar, Guittard Rogue cocoa powder, organic egg yolks,
                sea salt, vanilla extract
                Speckled Milky Chocolate featuring local Terroir Chocolate
                TC Chocolate in Fergus Falls, Minn is highlighted in this flavor. They are a bean-to-bar chocolatier
                meaning they purchase raw cocoa beans and do the laborious work of turning these beans into chocolate
                bars. The canvas of this flavor is a milky chocolate using their 70% cocoa bars. We melt this into
                Autumnwood Dairy’s milk and cream and then speckle this base, as the ice cream is churning, with their
                60% chocolate and you get bits of truffle-like goodness. Seriously local, seriously a must try.
                Ingredients: Autumnwood Farm cream and milk, cane sugar, Terroir Chocolate 60% (organic cocoa beans,
                organic cane sugar, organic cocoa butter, whole milk powder), Terroir Chocolate 70%(organic cocoa beans,
                organic cane sugar, organic cocoa butter), organic egg yolks.</p>
            <h3>Lavender</h3>
            <p>We steep dried lavender for 2-3 days to create lavender essence. A beautiful purple hue is created by
                using a bit of beet powder and butterfly pea flower.
                Ingredients: Autumnwood Farm cream and milk, cane sugar, lavender essence, organic egg yolks, organic
                beet powder, organic butterfly pea flower.</p>
            <h3>Black Garlic with Chocolate Chips <br>(contains soy)</h3>
            <p>This flavor was created during the start of the pandemic and we only sold it by the pint. Now we are
                scooping it and would highly encourage you to try a sample and this unique umami-rich ice cream. Black
                garlic is fresh garlic that has been fermented and aged until it turns black. Tasting notes of fig,
                raisin and balsamic.
                Ingredients: Autumnwood Farm cream and milk, cane sugar, organic black garlic, chocolate chips(cocoa
                mass, cocoa butter, vegetable oil, soy lecithin), organic egg yolks

                you this flavor with honeyberries from Dawson, Minn. Honeyberries are the new super fruit and have been
                known to be the most nutritious fruit. They are tart and are an amazing blending fruit with raspberries.
                The crisp is kinda like the topping of apple crisp using Sunrise Flour Mill heirloom whole wheat pastry
                flour, muscovado sugar, and Hope Creamery butter.
                Ingredients. Autumnwood Farm cream and milk, cane sugar, local honeyberries, black raspberries, organic

            <h3>Strawberry - using local berries!</h3>
            <p>Strawberries are fresh in June/July here in Minnesota and we take full advantage of that by bringing
                enough berries during the season and freezing them for year round use. This year we got gorgeous berries
                from T Berries in Avon, Minn, near my hometown. Most of the berries were picked by my family and I and
                I’m grateful for our bountiful harvest.
