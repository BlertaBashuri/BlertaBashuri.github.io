# Introduction Web Portfolio Blerta Bashuri 
This is my first Web Portfolio, and I will admit that it was one of the most enjoyable assignments so far. I can see the difference in how much I have learned and have grown my knowledge in coding. Grateful to Professor Rob for being so patient in teaching us and made us benefit from this course. Thank you so much for facilitating such a positive learning environment!
Regarding the Webpage:
- Family font use is MONTSERRAT, one of my favourite fonts, and I think the lines of this font make my page look more professional. [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
- Regarding the Web Portfolio, I have used half the images from [Unsplash](https://www.unsplash.com) half are my real work for privacy purposes. 
-Socialmedia icons [Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/)

## HOMEPAGE
The way that the homepage is displayed is one of my favourites layouts. I have chosen for navigation link for the homepage to use the logo of the Web Portfolio. When I decided, in the beginning, to do so, I find it a bit difficult to disable the hover style, but after trying different styles, I managed to fix it as needed just to style the hover for the homepage and leave all the rest.
1. Regarding the banner, I have decided that in most of the pages to be present a banner with a quote related to the page. For the image, I have used the background image option on CSS.
2. Using Bootstrap Grid for the body, the images, the text and the buttons. Bootstrap is a lifesaver and makes things easier, but I prefer the old style. Maybe I'm too excited about using codes. In the beginning, it was a bit hard because not sure how to float the text or the image for the tablet and Desktop screen. I realized that using order instead of the float was much easier for me in this case.
3. All the images are optimized, and they respond(grow and shrink) for different sizes using srcst attributes.
5. Footer of the page is simples and very useful. The user will find the `code` <a href="index.html">Shop</a> and <a href="cart.html">Cart</a>
Social Media significant part of a Portfolio webpage.

## ABOUT Page
- This is a simple page with the basics like the other pages; the navigation and the footer remain the same on every page.
- Banner is changed, and the blockquote and is customized for each page to be different.
- The text regarding the about changes it style on Desktop version where I find it more interesting to be in two columns rather than just in one like it is in Mobile and Tablet Version.

## PORTFOLIO Page
One of the pages required a lot of concentration and a lot of work.
- Navigation and the footer remains the same like every page.
- Background colour of the body is changed to HEX color #000000;
- Page is separated in four different sections. 
 `code` <a href="bio.html">

### BIOGRAPHY Page 
The biography page is represented by a picture, a header and a paragraph about the artistâ€”style changes with the change of the screen from mobile to tablet and desktop. The basic of the page remains the same like in the other pages regarding the navigation and the footer. 
### PHOTOGRAPHY Page 
The photography page is one of the pages where I decided to use the Bootstrap again for the grid. The difficulties started when I decided to put a label on the pictures until I discovered to use the tag of `code`<figcaption>Paint.1 - Birthplace.</figcaption> but the difficulties didn't end up in here when I did the HTML Validation it was necessary when we use the <figcaption> it has to be inside of a figure tag. One more obstacle that I encounter during the coding of this page was the MODAL. That was a half-day spent only on searching and researching how to use it until, in the end, it was successful the understanding regarding the MODAL. It is constructive and exciting when you get to know how to use it.

### Graphic Page and Paintings Page
Both pages are created by using the classic grid. The experiment of the Bootstrap ended with the Photography page. Regarding the labels of the images it is used again the `code` <figcaption>Graphic.1</figcaption>. Simple layout showing one column for mobile continues with two columns for a tablet and three for desktop.

### Contact Page
One of the pages that I mainly had fun with and spent more time on. Animation is another favourite world of mine regarding coding. It has so much to explore and to create. In my opinion, animation is essential in a Webpage to attract the user. 
In this case, I have used the logo that I have created for my Portfolio as an animation. The idea is logos coming out from the logo coming from small and increasing their size. In the beginning, it wasn't easy to arrange them or to make them appear only for the tablet and the desktop, but after creating a new class of div's to separate the animation from the other part of the coding, everything started to make sense. 
How to make the animation pleasant and not disturbing was another issue that I had during this coding. Important is to try and never give up and a little advice. 

Term: NOT TO ADD EXTRA CODE WHEN YOU SEE THAT YOUR CODE IS NOT WORKING. CHECK VALIDATE AND WORK on the CODE.

### BUY Page
Buy page is a page that redirects you to a page with a form to fill your card payments after you click on the buttons BUY on the homepage. 
### CART Page
A cart page is a page that shows you what you have put in the cart so far. But in this case, the page will show you that the cart has nothing to show because you haven't bought anything yet.

I hope you enjoy my page as I did create it.
Thank you :)
